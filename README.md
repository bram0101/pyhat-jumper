# pyhat-jumper
I created this game for fun. I am (as of the writing of this) in my first week of studying IT in college. We started off with these firat two weeks doing a cours called "smart things". We got a Raspberry Pi with a Sese Hat. Since I had no lessons the second day of the schoolyear, I decided to make a game. It is one of those jumping game like Geometry Dash or Mario.

## Controls
Pressing the joystick as a button or pressing up, will make you jump. If you hold it down you jump higher and you can double jump.
Pressing down will stop the game.

Keep in mind that the screen is rotated 90 degrees, so the joystick should be on the bottom left of the display.
